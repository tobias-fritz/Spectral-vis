# Spectral-vis

Computing and Visualising Absorption spectra from excitation energies.

- The procedure is based on [this article ](http://gaussian.com/uvvisplot/) from the gaussian website.

## Setup

- All dependencies can be installed using either pip or conda.<br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
`conda install --file requirements.txt` <br>

## How to use

- Since the application oppotunities for this script are rather broad an example usecase is given in the [example notebook](./example.ipynb).
- A single excitation energy or a list of energies and their corresponding osc. strengths can be provided.
